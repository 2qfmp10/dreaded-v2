Features

This bot is a modification of the predecessor dreaded-md but the module has been changed to CommonJS. It includes group management features, media commands, image manipulation commands, AI capabilities, and many other features.

Our AI features use random APIs to operate, so they may occasionally be down.

If you plan to host the bot on your server, VPS, locally, or on a panel, you need to add the session ID in the settings.js file under the constant session.


VPS/SSH/Termux Deploy

To host the bot on a server, VPS, or locally, follow these steps:

curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install nodejs -y

4. Run Bot in Background with pm2
If you want the bot to stay active even after disconnecting from the VPS, install pm2 and use it to start the bot:

sudo npm install pm2 -g
pm2 start index.js

> With Termux, you will need a stable device with continuous internet connection
